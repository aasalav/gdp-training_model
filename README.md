## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I want to find which parameters are good element predictors for GDP per capita for countries within SCHENGEN economic zone using a dataset from https://databank.worldbank.org/. For that I used available data from 1975 to 2024.

* Compare two commonly used models Linear Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF)
* Present the 2 models and explain their strengths and weakness and compared

Main objective of the project is to
Identify top indicators that can predict GDP

How?
1. Using two commonly used models Linear Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF)
2. Compare the 2 models and explain their strengths and weakness.

## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 Jupyther notebooks available that contains all the analysis and the codes. 
This file follows the crisp-dm methodology or Cross-industry standard process for data mining
 (link: Cross-industry standard process for data mining - Wikipedia )

The document is divided following these structure to help navigate the different sections
