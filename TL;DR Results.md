## Q1: Key Variables for Predicting GDP per Capita

### Important Features Identified by Both Linear Regression (LR) and Random Forest (RF):

- **Life Expectancy at Birth**  
  - RF importance score: 0.57  
  - LR correlation coefficient: 0.72  
- **Random Forest (RF) also highlights:**  
  Revenue, Adolescent Fertility Rate, Precipitation per Year, Water Productivity  
- **Linear Regression (LR) additionally emphasizes:**  
  School Enrollment, Water Productivity, Remittances, Revenue  

---

### Understanding Differences in Feature Importance: RF vs LR

- **Random Forest (RF):**  
  Evaluates feature importance based on how much each variable reduces prediction error across many decision trees.  
  - Captures **nonlinear relationships** and **feature interactions**.  
  - Importance reflects overall predictive contribution beyond simple correlations.

- **Linear Regression (LR):**  
  Assesses feature importance through correlation coefficients that measure **linear associations** with the target variable.  
  - Reflects direct, additive influence of each predictor.  

---

### Why Do Rankings Differ?

- RF accounts for complex patterns and interactions between variables, adjusting feature importance accordingly.  
- LR ranks features purely based on their linear correlation with GDP per capita, which may overemphasize variables strongly correlated with each other.  

---

### Example from Your Data

- *Life Expectancy* consistently ranks highly in both models, confirming it as a robust predictor.  
- RF assigns high importance to *Revenue* and *Adolescent Fertility Rate* due to their nonlinear effects.  
- LR highlights *School Enrollment* and *Remittances* because of their strong linear correlations with GDP per capita.

---

### Summary

- **Linear Regression** highlights variables with strong linear influence on GDP per capita.  
- **Random Forest** reveals a broader set of important predictors, including those involved in nonlinear relationships and interactions.  

Both approaches offer valuable insights, and combining their interpretations provides a more comprehensive understanding of key drivers of GDP per capita.

### Comparing LR vs RF methods

- **Using all variables improves model performance** for both Linear Regression and Random Forest, yielding higher R¬≤ and lower errors compared to using only the top 10 features.

- **Random Forest fits the training data better** and captures nonlinear relationships, resulting in slightly higher accuracy and robustness.

- **Both models perform similarly on test data** (Test R¬≤ ‚âà 0.83), indicating good generalization.

- **Linear Regression is simpler and more interpretable**, with coefficients that clearly represent feature effects.

<div style="border-left: 4px solid #228B22; padding: 10px; background-color: #f0fff0;">

### **Recommended approach:**  
Use **Random Forest for prediction** due to its better accuracy, and **Linear Regression for interpretability** to explain key drivers to stakeholders.

This hybrid strategy balances accuracy and transparency effectively.
